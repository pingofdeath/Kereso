<p class="subtitle"> Short Instructions </p>

<p> The above Java applet allows you to compare the searches performed by
Lifelong Planning A* and A*. Both search algorithms find shortest paths and,
in the Java applet, break ties in favor of vertices with smaller g-values.
Lifelong Planning A* generalizes A*. Like A*, it uses heuristics to speed up
the current search. Different from A*, it also uses information from previous
searches to speed up the current one. Press the "Run" button to start a
Lifelong Planning A* search in the left gridworld and an A* search in the
right gridworld. Then click on cells in the gridworlds to make them blocked or
empty and watch the search effort (green and blue cells) of the two search
algorithms as they find shortest paths from the start cell (S) to the goal
cell (G). The search effort of Lifelong Planning A* is especially small if
the changes occur close to the goal cell. It is usually much smaller than the
search effort of A* although it can also be larger (especially if the changes
occur close to the start cell). Longer instructions are given below. </p>

src="figs/rover2.jpg"> The version of Lifelong Planning A* for moving robots
is called Dynamic A* Lite (= D* Lite). D* Lite has been extended at Carnegie
Mellon University for use on their robots. For example, Dave Ferguson and Tony
Stentz from Carnegie Mellon University used elements of D* Lite in a highly
optimized version of their Field D* system. Joseph Carsten and Art Rankin from
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory installed this version of Field D* on the
Mars rovers "Spirit" and "Opportunity" (without any involvement by us) and
first let it control a rover on Mars in February 2007 after testing it on a
rover on Mars in November 2006. More information on D* Lite and our fast
replanning methods can be found on our project pages on <a
href="project-a.html" target="_top">fast replanning</a>. More information on
Field D* and how it relates to D* Lite can be found in D. Ferguson and
A. Stentz, <a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pubs/pub_5379.html" target="_top">

<p class="subtitle"> Additional Information </p>

<p> There are two identical gridworlds. The left one shows the search
performed by Lifelong Planning A* and the right one shows the search performed
by A*. In both cases, the cell marked S is the start cell of the search and
the cell marked G is the goal cell. One can move from any cell to any of its
eight neighboring cells as long as it is empty. Thus, one can squeeze
diagonally through two blocked cells. The cost of each move (including
diagonal moves) is one. Both Lifelong Planning A* and A* use the maximum of
the absolute differences of the x and y coordinates of two cells as an
approximation of their distance. </p>

<p> White, green, and blue cells are empty and black cells are blocked.  You
can click on an empty cell to make it blocked and vice versa. A white cell was
not expanded during the search, a green cell was expanded once, and a blue
cell was expanded twice. Each cell (except for the start cell and goal cell)
contains its g-value at the end of the search, which approximates the length
of a shortest path from the start cell to that cell. A dash means
infinity. The shortest path from the start cell to the goal cell is shown by a
line. The line is missing if there is no path from the start cell to the goal
cell. </p>

<p> Initially, no searches are performed to allow you to make some cells
blocked by clicking on them. Once you press the "Run" button, a Lifelong
Planning A* search is performed in the left gridworld and an A* search is
performed in the right gridworld and the results are shown. The results of the
first search should be completely identical. You can then continue to make
empty cells blocked and blocked cells empty by clicking on them. After every
change, another search is performed and the results are shown. The shortest
paths should always be identical but in many cases Lifelong Planning A* now
expands many fewer cells than A*. It might not even expand any cells at all!
In general, the search effort of Lifelong Planning A* is especially small if
the changes occur close to the goal cell. If you want to make several changes
at once, you can press the "Stop" button to suspend the searches and make all
changes. Once you press the "Run" button again, the searches continue, as
before. The "Reset" button resets the applet into its initial state. (Note
that you need to press the "Run" button again after pressing the "Reset"
button.)  </p>

<p class="subtitle"> Truth in Advertizing </p>

<p> The applet compares the number of cell expansions of Lifelong Planning A*
and A* with the same tie-breaking rule. However, it is important to note that
A* expands cells faster than Lifelong Planning A*. Also, Lifelong Planning A*
and A* can break ties in favor of vertices with larger g-values and then tend
to expand fewer cells (especially in empty gridworlds, where the number of
ties is large). These issues are discussed in the papers given below. </p>

<p> The programming was done by Colin Bauer as part of a student project.
Please send bug reports to <A HREF="MAILTO:skoenig@usc.edu">Sven Koenig</A>,
after checking that you have indeed enabled Java in your preferences. Note
that the code is not efficient and thus not what you want to use as a starting
point for an implementation! Better code is given below. Note that this code
still breaks ties in favor of vertices with smaller g-values, but the papers
given below explain how to change the tie-breaking rule. </p>
