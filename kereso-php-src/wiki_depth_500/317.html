<P>
Best first search is a little like hill climbing, in that it
uses an evaluation function and always chooses the next node to
be that with the best score. However, it is exhaustive, in that
it should eventually try all possible paths. It uses an agenda
as in breadth/depth first search, but instead of taking the
first node off the agenda (and generating its successors)
it will take the <em>best</em> node off, ie the node with the
best score. The successors of the best node will be evaluated
(ie have a score assigned to them) and added to the list.
<P>
The basic algorithm is as follows:
<P>
<OL><LI> Start with <em>open</em> = [initial-state].
<LI> While <em>open</em> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_778_tex2html_wrap1053.xbm"> [] do
<OL><LI> Pick the best node on <em>open</em>.
<LI> If it is the goal node then return with success. Otherwise
find its succesors.
<LI> Assign the successor nodes a score using the evaluation function
and add the scored nodes to <em>open</em>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>
(Remember ``open'' is just what we have called the agenda.)
<P>
Suppose we have the following search tree:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_778_tex2html_wrap1069.xbm">
<P>
Here links between nodes illustrate possible successor states. A node label
such as B:5 means that the node name is B and it has n estimated
cost to solution of 5, (so a lower value is better).
<P>
Suppose our goal state is G. 
If we searched this search space using breadth first search then the
nodes would be searched in the following order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Using depth first search the order would be: A, B, D, E, G.
For both of these the scores on nodes are ignored. Using
simple hill climbing a solution would never be found - there is a local
maxima at C where it would get stuck. Using best first search the
order would be: A, C, B, E, G. You should verify this using the
algorithm above.
<P>
If you have a good evalution function, best first search may
drastically cut down the amount of search that you have
to do to find a solution. You may not find the best solution (or at least,
the first soln found may not be the best),
 but if a solution exists you will eventually find it, and there
is a good chance of finding it quickly. Of course, if your
evaluation function is no good then you are just as well off
using simpler search techniques such as depth first or
breadth first. And if your evaluation function is very expensive
(ie, it takes a long time to work out a score) the benefits of
cutting down on the amount of search may be outweighed by the
costs of assigning a score.
