<h1>
Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest Pairs Algorithm</h1>

<h2>
<a NAME="introduction"></a>A (Very) Brief Introduction to Graphs</h2>
Graphs are a very important data structure in computer science. Many otherwise
very difficult problems can be expressed in terms of a graph and solved
using standard graph searching/manipulation algorithms. Graphs can be simply
viewed as a set of <b>vertices</b>/nodes and <b>edges</b> connecting these
vertices. Mathematically G = (V,E), if u and v are elements of V, then
an edge can be denoted as (u,v).
<p>Graphs can be basically classified as either being <b>undirected</b>
or <b>directed</b>. In the former, the edges do not have a direction i.e.
(u,v) and (v,u) denote the same edge. In the latter the edges have a direction.
Another important aspect of graphs is the identification of cycles. A cycle
is a path such that the first vertex and the last vertex are the same.
The following illustrates a directed graph that contains cycles and negatively
weighted edges (see below). The graph consists of 5 vertices and 9 edges.

<a NAME="shortest_path"></a>Shortest Paths</h2>
It is also possible that the edges in a graph may bear weights, these may
be positive, negative, or zero. If these weights correspond to a distance
than a question can be asked as to what is the distance between two points
on a graph. It is possible to approach this from a number of different
perspectives. It may be that the shortest path between two specified nodes
is required, or the distance between a single point and all other nodes,
or more completely, what is the shortest distance between all nodes and
all other nodes within a graph. The later question is known as the 'all-pair-shortest-path'
problem and is discussed below.
<h3>
<a NAME="all_pairs"></a>All-Pairs-Shortest-Path Algorithms</h3>
The problem of finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices
on a graph is akin to making a table of all of the distances between all
pairs of cities on a road map. Additionally, the route that gives rise
to this shortest path also needs to be established. This is one of many
interesting problems that can be solved using graph algorithms.
<p>There are a variety of solutions to this problem and the algorithms
that can be applied often depend on whether negative weighs are present
in the graph. For example, if no negative weights exists than it is possible
to run Dijkstra's single-source shortest-path algorithm |V| times which
has a run time of O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) (although enhancements can be made).
Where negative weights are present the Bellman-Ford algorithm could be
run from each vertex.&nbsp; [<a href="../references.html#Corman">Corman</a>]
For a dense graph (one with many connections) this has a run time of O(|V|<sup>4</sup>).
Another solution for graphs containing negative weights is known as the
'Slow-All-Pairs-Shortest-Path algorithm, however this again has a run time
of O(|V|<sup>4</sup>).&nbsp; [<a href="../references.html#Corman">Corman</a>]
It is possible to do this using the Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs-Shortest-Path
algorithm. This is discussed in the next section.
<h4>
<a NAME="Floyd-Warshall"></a>Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs-Shortest-Path algorithm</h4>
The Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs-Shortest-Path algorithm uses a dynamic-programming
methodology to solve the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path problem. The algorithm
runs in O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) time and negatively weighed edges may be present,
however negatively weighted cycles cause problems with the algorithm.
<p>For a detailed description of the dynamic approach used in the Floyd-Warshall
algorithm see Corman's textbook. [<a href="../references.html#Corman">Corman</a>]
<p>The main recursive definition of the algorithm is given by:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="floyd_al.gif" BORDER=0 height=128 width=548 align=BOTTOM>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This leads to the following bottom-up procedure to compute the all-pairs-shortest-path
table.
<p><img SRC="floyd_ps.gif" BORDER=0 height=271 width=433 align=BOTTOM>
<h4>
<a NAME="constructing"></a>Constructing The Shortest Path</h4>
The algorithm and pseudo-code outlined above provide the shortest distance
between all of the vertices in terms of a table (new adjacency matrix).
However, using the above procedure provides no information on the specific
pathway that gives rise to these values. In order to construct the shortest
pathway a predecessor matrix (<font face="Symbol">P</font>) is required
to be calculated at each major cycle (corresponding to k in the above pseudo-code).
This method can be implemented in O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) time so not to alter
the order of the algorithm.
<p>A recursive formulation of the problem can be specified as:
<p><img SRC="floyd_pa.gif" BORDER=0 height=212 width=492 align=BOTTOM>
<p>where <font face="Symbol">P</font> is the parent matrix, d is the distance
matrix, and W is the weighs matrix.
<h4>
<a NAME="visualization"></a>Visualization of The Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs-Shortest-Path
Algorithm</h4>
The following Java (using JDK 1.1) applet has been developed to enable
the processing performed, and the result obtained from the Floyd-Warshall
All-Pairs-Shortest-Path algorithm to be visualized. Both the distance corresponding
to the shortest paths as well as the path itself is calculated.
<p>The applet consists essentially of two sections. The left portion of
the applet shows a pictorial representation of the graph that is specified
in an adjacency matrix that appears to its right. (Note: To simplify the
coding I have used dots rather than arrow heads to indicate the direction
of a particular edge. Also two colours, black and red, have been used to
distinguish forward and back edges (based purely on node number).
<p>The adjacency matrix has been preloaded with the values that give rise
to the graph depicted above. The weights appearing in the adjacency matrix
can be altered by the user. In order to update the graph such that it corresponds
to an altered matrix simple click on the 'Update' button. You can return
to the default values by clicking on the 'Reset' button.
<p>The calculation of the shortest paths is initiated by selecting the
'Floyd-Warshall' button. During this calculation the adjancy matrix is
replaced by the shortest path matrix and the values are upadted (and highlighted)
as the algorithm progresses. If the 'single step' checkbox has been marked
than the applet should pause at the end of each cycle (Note: at least that
was the intention, however I have noted some problems with the pausing
in some browsers). Once the full Floyd-Warshall calculation is complete,
each entry in the matrix provides the shortest distance each pair of nodes.
For example if a value of 1 lies at the intersection of the 5th row with
the 3rd column than this is the shortest distance from vertex 5 to vertex
3. After the calculation is complete the actual shortest path between any
two vertices is displayed by being superimposed on the graph itself. The
'choice box' enables the path between any two vertices to be chosen.
<p><b>Please note:</b> that as the applet has been written in Java (JDK
1.1) you will need to use a browser capable of displaying such applets.
One example of such a browser is Netscape 4.5.

<h2>
The Floyd-Warshall Applet Code</h2>

<p><br>The code for the applet consists of two classes, and associated
inner classes that handle user interface events and the drawing of the
graphical representation of the graph. The main class is <a href="javaCode/shortest_path.java">shortest_path.java</a>
contains most of the code (abour 600 lines including comments) whilst a
simple <a href="javaCode.java">Msgbox.java</a> class contains the code
for the modal 'pop-up' window used during the single step operation of
the simulation to pause the operation of the code between each iteration.
<p>It is not the intention of this thesis to detail the operation of the
shortest_path code but merely present the result of the code development
in this field. The code itself contains comments that should enable the
function of each section to be evident.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>

<p><br>As with many algorithms it is the dynamic nature of the operation
of the code that leads to the observed property. The applet developed in
this section of the project has targeted the simulation of the Floyd-Warshall
all-pairs-shortest-path problem. It is easy to understand the simple three
nested <tt>FOR</tt> loops of the pseudocode. However, it is much more difficult
to envisage the whole process and understand how the actual shortest-paths
are computed. It is my hope that this applet will bridge that gap and aid
in the understand of this particular process.
